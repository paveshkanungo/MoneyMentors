# MoneyMentors: Your Empowering Finance Study Platform (MERN Stack)

# Problem Statement
My friends often discussed finance and investments, but I found it difficult to understand their conversations. The complex terms and fast pace made it challenging to follow. To learn more, I started researching financial topics online. However, many helpful resources require high payment. Also, I observed a significant gap in financial literacy among my peers. Complex financial topics were often discussed in an unstructured manner, making it difficult for beginners to understand. Also, India's financial literacy rate is alarmingly low, with only 27% of the population possessing basic financial knowledge. This experience inspired me to create a low-paid platform where people could easily learn about finance.
